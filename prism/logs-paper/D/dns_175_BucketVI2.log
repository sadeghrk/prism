Iterative method did not converge within after 1000 seconds.
Iterative method: 36431600 iterations in 1000.00 seconds (average 0.000027, setup 4.32)

Error: Iterative method did not converge within 36431600 iterations.
Consider using a different numerical method or increasing the maximum number of iterations.
